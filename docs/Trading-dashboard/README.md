Explanatory Note for the Test Task
Developer: Mikhail Petrushkov

Dear reviewer, greetings! You can view the trading dashboard here 
As part of completing this test task, I’ve done the following work:

Design implementation:
The design was faithfully reproduced.
All alignments and typography were preserved.  See the screenshot at this link

HTML and CSS quality:
Used semantically correct HTML elements
Wrote clean SCSS without Tailwind
Followed BEM methodology

Accessibility:
Used semantically appropriate tags
Inputs and buttons are accessible via keyboard
Icon-only buttons have aria-label attributes

Performance and best practices:
Tried to minimize DOM depth
!Note In a couple of places, fixed values were used intentionally:
 Left navigation and right sidebar (Trade and Time & Sales)
Chart blocks have fixed height, while the width is responsive
Elsewhere, no fixed values were used

Bonus Points:
Design was implemented for screen widths between 375px and 1440+px (mobile, tablet, desktop)
A universal mixin was created for font sizing https://gyazo.com/1791a86a30d75ffc203687e47d351e0b
Colors were moved to variables https://gyazo.com/0e77f3c4c0b451bfbde4048365442a0f
Introduced a “color flags” technique:  https://gyazo.com/23f0f2f755e3ab4db6c7416428b14689. 
Pros: quick color management. 
Cons: cluttered markup
The project was built without Tailwind 
All icons are included via SVG sprite, not through img
Project Setup Instructions
For your convenience, the project is available for viewing via a link. no need to download or install anything.. You can view the SCSS source files here  

Additional Notes
Some blocks and UI controls would be hidden on tablet and mobile screens to simplify the interface and improve UX.
